# Torrent Filename Parser

A metadata extractor that parses torrent filenames of TV Series.
Some of the RegEx patterns are from [jzjzjzj](https://github.com/jzjzjzj/parse-torrent-name).

I created this function long time ago to learn advanced JavaScript concepts by doing a simple data extraction from a simple string of a file name.

## TODO

- Add tests
